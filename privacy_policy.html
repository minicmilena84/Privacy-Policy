    <section>
      <p><code class="placeholder">SportVid</code> (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains what information we handle, how we use it, and your choices when using our mobile application.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1) Information Collection</h2>
      <p>We do not collect, store, or share personal information such as your name, email, phone number, payment details, or precise location. The app does not require account registration.</p>
      <p>We may collect <strong>non-personal data</strong> such as device type, operating system version, and app usage statistics solely to improve app performance and user experience. This data cannot identify you personally.</p>
      <p><strong>All user content</strong> (such as saved links, videos, or images) is processed and stored locally on your device. We do not upload or share your files with any server or third party. There is no collection of personal data — everything remains on your device.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2) Permissions</h2>
      <p>The app may request basic Android permissions (e.g., storage access or internet connection) strictly to provide functionality. We do not use permissions to gather personal information.</p>
      <p>You can manage and revoke app permissions at any time from your device settings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3) Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The app does not integrate third-party analytics or advertising networks, unless explicitly stated inside the app. If ads are displayed, they are served through Google AdMob in compliance with Google Play policies and are subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4) AI-Generated Content</h2>
      <p>All images, icons, and visual elements used in this app are fully AI-generated. They do not depict real persons, brands, logos, or copyrighted material.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5) Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The app is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6) Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect any information you choose to share with us (e.g., via email support). While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. Use of the app is at your own risk.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7) Your Rights & Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our practices, contact us at <a href="mailto:devmivox@gmail.com"><code class="placeholder">devmivox@gmail.com</code></a>. If you ever provide information to us (e.g., by contacting support), you may request access or deletion of that information via the same email.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8) Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page, with the “Last updated” date adjusted accordingly.</p>
