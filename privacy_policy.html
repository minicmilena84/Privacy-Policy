    <section>
      <h2>1) Information Collection</h2>
      <p>We do not collect, store, or share personal information such as your name, email, phone number, payment details, or precise location. The app does not require account registration.</p>
      <p>We may collect <strong>non-personal data</strong> such as device type, operating system version, and basic app usage statistics solely to improve performance and user experience. This data does not identify you.</p>
      <p><strong>All user content</strong> (such as saved links, videos, or images) is processed and stored locally on your device. We do not upload or share your files with any server or third party.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2) Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app may request access to <strong>your camera</strong> so that you can take photos or record videos directly inside the app. These files remain on your device and are not uploaded or shared with us or with third parties.</p>
  <p>The app may also request access to <strong>your photos and videos</strong> so that you can import and save existing media content. Again, all files remain on your device and are not shared.</p>
  <p>In addition, the app may request basic permissions such as storage access or internet connection strictly to provide functionality. We do not use permissions to gather personal information. You can manage and revoke permissions at any time in your device settings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3) Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The app does <strong>not</strong> use third-party analytics or advertising services, and does not share data with third parties.</p>

      <h2>4) AI-Generated Content</h2>
      <p>Some images, icons, and visual elements in the app may be AI-generated and are not intended to depict real persons, brands, or copyrighted material.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>5) Children’s Privacy</h2>

    <section>
      <h2>6) Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect any information you choose to share with us (e.g., via email support). While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. Use of the app is at your own risk.</p>
